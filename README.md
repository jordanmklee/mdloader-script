# mdloader-script

A simple executable to easily flash firmware to Massdrop keyboards. Helpful for users that are not terminal-savvy, or to save time from repeatedly typing commands to try different keyboard mappings. Tested using MacOS Catalina and a Drop ALT keyboard.

## Usage

1. Download all files from repo
2. Create a keyboard mapping from https://drop.com/mechanical-keyboards/configurator, and save to the same folder
3. Run `flash.command` and press reset button on keyboard
